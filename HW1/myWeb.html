            He is an anthropomorphic hedgehog/Black Arm hybrid and the arch-rival of Sonic the Hedgehog. Shadow was created as the "Ultimate <br>
            Life Form" (究極生命体 Kyūkyoku Seimeitai?) by Gerald Robotnik, using the DNA of Black Doom, and is the end result of Project Shadow.<br> 
            His purpose was to provide ways to develop a cure for incurable deadly illnesses, more specifically for Gerald's granddaughter Maria Robotnik,<br> 
            but he was captured and put into stasis by the military when he was deemed as a threat to humanity.<br>

            Fifty years later, Shadow was released by Dr. Eggman in order to enlist him in his plan to conquer the world. Initially, Shadow worked with him,<br> 
            but secretly sought to destroy the planet in order to avenge Maria, who had been killed by the military, but was persuaded to help save it from Gerald's<br>
            doomsday plans. In the process, Shadow lost his memories and as such, sought to uncover the truth of his past, <br>
            during which he met Black Doom and the Black Arms; in the end, Shadow regained his memories, uncovered the truth and thwarted Black Doom's<br> 
            agenda and saved the world. From there, he continued his mission to protect humanity by becoming a special agent of GUN.<br>

            Shadow is sharp-witted, always on edge and has a strong sense of purpose, willing to accomplish his goals by any means.<br> 
            Essentially a dark version of Sonic, Shadow can match him in both speed and skill, and can use Chaos Control with a Chaos Emerald.<br>
            While preferring to work alone, he has helped Sonic and his allies when needed.<br>
